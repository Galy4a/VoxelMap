# VoxelMap
VoxelMap is a MiniMap for Minecraft. Originally, the VoxelMap was created by <a href="https://github.com/MamiyaOtaru/voxelmap">MamiyaOtaru</a>. Unfortunately, he has not made any updates since 1.17. And we decided to continue updating the VoxelMap. Unfortunately, we have not received an answer from MamiyaOtaru anywhere, which means that we currently do not have the possibility to publish the VoxelMap on CurseForge or Modrinth.

## Updates
There will be future updates for the VoxelMap here. You can download all versions from 1.19-1.19.4 on my <a href="https://jenkins.fantacs.de/job/VoxelMap/">Jenkins</a>. The latest versions will also be published in the releases from now on. (For older versions you have to join our <a href="https://discord.gg/4nGrfZxb2a">Discord Server</a> server).

## Issues
If you notice any bugs, you can either create an <a href="https://github.com/VoxelMap2/VoxelMap/issues">issue</a> or report it in our <a href="https://discord.gg/4nGrfZxb2a">Discord Server</a>.
